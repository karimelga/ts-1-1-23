Program Control - Member C

Purpose: The ProgramController class connects command-line arguments to the FileOpener and SubstitutionKey components. It does not directly access the file system. It coordinates program flow and ensures proper error handling.

Responsibilities:
1. If no arguments are provided:
        - Request available files from FileOpener
        - Display them in numbered format starting at 01

2. If one argument is provided:
        - Parse the numeric selection
        - Validate range
        - Request file contents from FileOpener
        - Return the contents

3. If two arguments are provided:
        - Perform file selection
        - Load the specific cipher key
        - Decipher filer content before returning it

4. Error Handling:
        - Non-numeric selection produces an error message
        - Out-of-range selection produces an error message
        - File read failures produces and error message
        - Invalid key file produces an error message
        - The program exists after displaying output

Design Decisions:
- File numbering begins at 01 and uses two-digit formatting
- Index mapping is selection minus 1
- ProgramController does not directly access disk files
- Cipher functionality is delegated to SubstitutionKey

Testing Plan:
- Unit tests use a FakeFileOpener to avoid direct disk access
- Tests verify file listing, selection validation, content return, and error handling
- Each logical branch in ProgramController is tested
