Our team uses the FileOpenerImplementation class as the exclusive
tool for accessing external data (the files) as a part of the methods
associated with the class. My plan was for the team to use .getFileContent(String fileName) to parse through the
file given (fileName). For files with a lot of the data they could use .getFileLines(String fileName) in order
to parse through large files. The .getAvailableFiles() and .getDir(File file) both list the files/directories under "docs"
or param File. Bradley, Jay and Tugce successfully implemented this plan structure for their respective parts.
