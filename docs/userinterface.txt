Bradley Ayieko pgc4zz

Program name:
    java topsecret

Purpose:
    Gives a command line interface that, based on certain parameters, either lists all available files, or reads and
    displays the contents of the files based on a key.

Usage:
    java topsecret
        Lists all of the numbered available files

    java topsecret <nn>
        Reads and displays the contents of the selected file using the default deciphering key.

    java topsecret <nn> <key>
        Reads and displays the contents of the selected file using the chosen deciphering key.

Arguments:
    <nn> File number (2 digits. Ex. 01, 02, 03)
    <key> Optional alternative cipher key

Validation:
    - If no arguments are given, a list of the files should be displayed
    - If one argument is given, it should be the 2 digit file number. If it is not, an error message should be displayed
    - If two arguments are given, the first one should be the 2 digit file number, and the second one should be the
      alternate deciphering key. If they are not in that order and correct format, then an error message should be
      displayed
    - If there are more than two arguments, then an error message should be thrown.

Notes:
    - The program ends after showing the file list, the contents of an indicated file, or after displaying an error
      message.
    - If "java topsecret" were called, it should output in the following format:
        01 filea.txt
        02 fileb.txt
        03 filec.txt
