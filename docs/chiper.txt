This program will support the decryption of substitution ciphers, and it will do so through the use
of the class SubstitutionKey.

On construction, the class will take in a path to a key file on construction and validate then
generate a substitution key from the first two lines of the file.

The first line in key files will represent the true base characters.
The second line in key files will represent the cipher characters that will be swapped out for
true characters.

i.e.
Lets say file key.txt is used to construct a substitution key, and it holds:
abc
ABC

key.txt has base character line [abc]
and substitution line [ABC]
and this would map to a substitution key of
A->a
B->b
C->c

Thus ciphered text ABBCCA would be decrypted into abbcca.

Invalid keys involve files with less than 2 lines, files with duplicated characters in base
character line, and files having substitution line and base character line mismatched in length.

The method decipher in SubstitutionKey returns a decrypted string from an encrypted string,
using the substitution key generated upon construction with key file.

Any characters not represented in base character line will simply remain the same in the
decrypted string.
